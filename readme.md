A place to put some hacky scripts for bulk searches via the Bing API.

Inspired by (and most code taken nearly verbatim from) [Thilo Huellmann](https://github.com/thilohuellmann)'s [article](https://codeburst.io/bulk-researching-linkedin-contacts-with-python-microsofts-bing-api-1f9a19e1c7b) and [Gist](https://gist.github.com/thilohuellmann/c25419c95dfb4383b106f144ba7c775d).

Mostly just LinkedIn lookups.
